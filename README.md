Mod for Barony: Professional HUD - Closer to center
FOR version v4.3.0.
Much more comfortable HP/MP and buffs/debuffs position (closer to center, nearby to crosshair)
Tired of dying because of Levitation wears off, but you didn't see this because you were fighting Imp? Then this mod for you.

WARNING:
I don't know exactly, but if you have another mod that changes HUD_settings.json there might be conflict. Also don't enable both aspect ratio mods.
Optimized for 5:4 aspect ratio.
Doesn't disable achievements.

Installation:

    Press on green button Code>Download ZIP>Unpack ZIP>You will find folder Professional HUD 5-4AR, drop it in mods folder.

Steam version:

Other versions:

    You can find them in different branches.

Want to change position?

    Go to Professional HUD 5-4AR/data/HUD_settings.json
    Find entry with "hpmpbar" (144 line).
    Change "hpmpbar_x_offset" for X position and "hpmpbar_y_offset" for Y position. I don't know how to exactly do accurate measurement so it's just a lot of guessing and trys. That's what i did anyway.

Notice: if mod updates, your changes will reset. Write numbers somewhere.
