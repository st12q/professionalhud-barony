Mod for Barony: Professional HUD - Closer to center
Much more comfortable HP/MP and buffs/debuffs position (closer to center, nearby to crosshair)
Tired of dying because of Levitation wears off, but you didn't see this because you were fighting Imp? Then this mod for you.

WARNING:
I don't know exactly, but if you have another mod that changes HUD_settings.json there might be conflict. Also don't enable both aspect ratio mods.
Optimized for 5:4 aspect ratio.
Doesn't disable achievements.

Other versions:

    Version for 4:3 AR: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3281958237
    Version for 16:9 and 16:10 AR: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3281956896
    Version for 43:18 (3440x1440) AR: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3281957555


Want to change position?

    Go to DRIVELETTER:/Steam/steamapps/workshop/content/371970/3281957927/data/HUD_settings.json
    Find entry with "hpmpbar" (144 line).
    Change "hpmpbar_x_offset" for X position and "hpmpbar_y_offset" for Y position. I don't know how to exactly do accurate measurement so it's just a lot of guessing and trys. That's what i did anyway.

Notice: if mod updates, your changes will reset. Write numbers somewhere.
